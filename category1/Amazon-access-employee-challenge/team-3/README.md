# How to train models and make predictions on a new test set

The file list with description

1) Files for models training:
[01]train.gbm.freq.hom2.R
[01]train.gbm.freq.hom3.R
[01]train.gbm.lme.R
[01]train.gbm.occurs.R
[01]train.glmnet.R
[01]train.glmnet2.R
[01]train.libfm.R
[01]train.lr.R
[01]train.lr2.R
[01]train.rf.freq.R
[02]train.gbm.freq.hom5.R
[02]train.gbm.occurs.xor.libfm.R

2) File for the final ensembling
[03]ensembling.R

3) Python code for logistic regression
logistic_regression.py

4) File with helper functions
fn.base.R

# To calculate model

1) Copy initial train.csv and test.csv to the folder data.
2) Copy libFM binary file (libfm.exe) to the folder libfm.
3) Run all R files with prefix [01] (they can be run in parallel).
To run any R file, open it in R GUI, set directory to the file location and run the code.
4) Run all R files with prefix [02]
5) Run [03]ensembling.R
6) The file prediction.csv contains final prediction for the test set.
